# RAG 101
Repository for a tutorial on Retrieval Augmented Generation

The goal of this repository is to explore the techniques for giving LLMs context over private, recent or specific data in order to avoid LLMs hallucinations or them not being able to give a proper answer.

This set of techniques are commonly known as RAG, that stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.

In <b><u>GLOSSARY.md</u></b> you can find basic concepts on Machine Learning, LLMs and RAG that will be useful for a better understanding of the tutorial.
